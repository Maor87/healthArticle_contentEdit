    <h1>THE NEW HEALTH REVOLUTION!</h1>
 <p>   
  <strong>
   Growing up, Dinesh Fernando reveled in the fizz of 
   his beloved sugary drinks, blind to the hidden sugar
   content. Over time, his fondness for these sweet
   beverages spiraled into a daunting diabetes battle.
   Dinesh's tale is sadly not unique in Sri Lanka. 
   <br><br>
   Sri Lanka, for the first time in the country,
   new health measures will be passed in by
   law for sugary beverage products to help the
   public make better health decisions.
   <br><br>
   <h3>The New Color System</h3>
   The Ministry of Health announced, 
   "From August 1, it will be mandatory
   to smack color codes to all soft drinks
   based on their sugar content percentage." 
   This initiative, known as traffic light
   labelling, will instantly inform consumers
   if the sugar quantity in a soft drink is 
   high, medium, or low.
   <br><br>
   Red will be displayed if the sugar content is more than
   12 grams per 100 milliltres, while amber points to a dose of
   between 2g and 12g. Green denotes that the drink
   has a sugar content of less than 2g.
   The government plans to introduce a similar
   color coding system, to expose salt and fat
   content in various types of food.
   <br><br>
   <h3>Big Change's</h3>
   The latest measures, based on World Health
   Organization guidelines for healthy sugar
   consumption, have been in the works for five years.
   The plans were unveiled by the minister for health 
   nutrition and indigenous medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
   <br><br>
   Under the new law's, cafes, food outlets and 
   restaurants will have to offer sugar and salt separately 
   instead of adding them to the meal or hot drink.
   Minister Senaratne said: 'taxes on sugar will also
   increase as part of a package of new health boosting
   measures'.
   <br><br>
   <h3>Free to Pick</h3>
   Color codes will appear alongside other
   information on food and drink items, such as the list
   of ingredients, details about their nutritional value,
   allergy warnings, and expiry dates.
   The changes are aimed to making it easier for
   people to pick healthier drink options.
   <br><br>
   With green indicating low amounts, it is the
   healthier choice.
   With amber indicating medium amounts, one may
   gulp down food and drink with ambers, most of the time.
   <br><br>
   <h3>Some Push Back</h3>
   The ministry for health said: 'A meeting was held with 
   soft drink manufacturers registered under the Sri Lanka
   Chamber of Commerce about the implementation of color coding'.
   Still, not everyone supports the government's latest measures.
   <br><br>
   'Some soft-drink manufactures have said they were
   against the proposals, however still
   legally ablogated', said the minister.
   One european beverage company even considered exiting
   the Sri Lankan market as a result.
   The government was prompted to act as the nation's
   health continues to worsen.
   <br><br>
   Some health professionals say the daily sugar
   requirements is between 10g and 12g, or two
   teaspoons, per day whereas the average Sri Lankan
   consumes about 60g per day.
   <br><br>
   <h3>The Raise of Diabetes</h3>
   A survey carried out in the Western Province
   had revealed that the sugar consumption level
   there, particularly among children, was higher 
   than it was on average, across all Sri Lankan provinces.
   Children who are overweight are more likely
   to develop illnesses such as Type-2 diabetes,
   have an increased likelihood of weight and health
   problems in adolescence, and are more likely to
   become overweight or obese adults.
   <br><br>
   'Over 70% of hospital patients suffer from
   diseases caused by excessive consumption of sugar,
   salt, and fat. These measures are part of a broader
   government effort to reverse this troubling trend and
   improve Sri Lankan health'. The minister of health said.
   <br><br>
   The minister also said: 'Another of his ambitions
   is to make Sri Lanka's health care system as
   good as others in more developed countries'.
   The objective of this regulation was to make it easier
   for people to make better choices based on how
   healthy a particular drink is.
   <br><br>
   Let Dinesh's story be our wake-up call.
   With this new initiative, we envision a 
   healthier Sri Lanka, where tales of sugar 
   induced illnesses become rare. Together, we can
   embrace this change and secure a healthier future.
